Homework(2): Desing Review

- I don't think so that these data members (attributes) are all useful for a bank, like for what the bank will use the preferences of the person (favourite*)
- For datatypes I think that in the preferences variables it's good to use arrays because so many have a lot of preferences so the may have more than one preferences.

- You can add:
	* string cellPhone;
	* string (some legal info);
